What to do to succeed in the online taxi market?

The study of consumer behavior and consumer behavior science is the solution to the problem. 
In competitive markets such as a highly taxed online taxi, getting the most out of customer satisfaction is a prime concern.

Online taxi with passengers and drivers are both the main pillars of this startup, 
each of which is somehow influenced by the service and affecting it.

Most consumers of this service are young people interested in technology, 
and this service is still not widely spread among middle-aged people. 
Therefore, advertising and product introduction in places where network users are present 
can help increase the attention and confidence of young audiences.

Relevant discounts, respect for customers, easy access to the app, 
along with the ability to track the route of the car on the track can greatly affect the attention of the audience.

In addition, drivers must be provided with the minimum facilities needed to increase their work motivation 
and efforts to help them increase their customer satisfaction.
